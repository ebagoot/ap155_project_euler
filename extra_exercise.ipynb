    "    - Determine how many rows and columns the left and right matrices have. Which numbers should match in order for us to have valid matrix multiplication?\n",
    "    - Iterating the elements of \"list-of-lists\" gives us the rows, but we need to iterate the columns for the right matrix. Use the <code>transpose_matrix</code> function, then iteratively apply <code>scalar_product</code>."
